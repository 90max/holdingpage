				<p class='quote' id='haroldE'>'Brian Cathcart's vastly entertaining narrative marries the scepticism of an investigative journalist with a dramatist's gift for suspense. Four desperate men rowing a boat in the open sea! Post-chaises thundering along the country roads! How dull by comparison are our smug digital days where news comes - and goes - at the speed of light'
