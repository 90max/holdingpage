				<p id='title'><span>THE NEWS FROM WATERLOO</span>,</p> 
				<p id='description'>The race to tell Britain of Wellington's victory,</p>
				<h3 id='byAuthor'>by Brian Cathcart</h3><br>
				<h3 class='promise'>The website will be live soon, bringing you a full range of news and background about the book.</h3>
				<h3 class='promise'>In the meantime here is some early praise for it:</h3>

				<p class='quote' id='haroldE'>'Brian Cathcart's vastly entertaining narrative marries the scepticism of an investigative journalist with a dramatist's gift for suspense. Four desperate men rowing a boat in the open sea! Post-chaises thundering along the country roads! How dull by comparison are our smug digital days where news comes - and goes - at the speed of light' 
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>- Sir Harold Evans, newspaper editor and author.<span></p>

				<p class='quote' id='tonyR'>'A fascinating eye-opener into one of the most significant moments in British history, well researched and written in an exuberant style' 
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span>- Sir Tony Robinson, actor, author and presenter of TV's Time Team.<span></p>
